The ARKit is a platform developed by Apple that allows the user to develop augmented reality apps for the iPhone and iPad. 
It comes with a lot of built in functions that normally would have to be programmed in. 
Apple introduced the ARKit in September of 2017.
IKEA used the ARKit in order to allow customers to see the furniture in their house before they bought it.
The popular game Pokémon Go also used the ARKit to allow players the ability to catch Pokémon in the real world. 

There are three major parts of the ARKit.
Tracking – keeps track of your device and surrounding objects in order to keep the AR image in the same place. 
Scene Understanding – Identifies different objects and properties in the camera view.
Rendering – generates the image to be virtually placed. 

The ARKit was made to allow developers an easy way to begin making augmented reality apps. 

The ARKit has a lot of built in functions that are necessary for AR to function correctly. 

Since this is a product of apple it can only be used on macs, iPhones, and iPads.
The iPhones and iPads also need to have an A9 chip in order to be able to use AR. 

Using this there will be no motion sickness because it is augmented reality not virtual reality. 

If you are not able to use the ARKit there is also the ARCore, an Android software development kit, similar to the ARKit. 

The ARKit can be used in Gaming, Medical, Maintenance , and Navigation. 

This is a good way to start developing augmented reality applications. With a lot of major components to AR already included this makes for an easy way to begin developing AR apps.
